- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kami-I
- 👀 I’m interested in software development with a specific focus on Python and Javascript.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Django & React Frameworks to enable myself to build websites fast.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a lot of projects, as soon as I feel that I have grasped the other core concepts of the Frameworks.
- 
- 📫 How to reach me ...uhm...I'd like to think that Github has a feature where we can send dm's or something :) (will check), if not....I will definately update this! :D
